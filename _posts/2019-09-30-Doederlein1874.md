### [Hand-book of Latin Synonymes, Döderlein (1875)][1] v1.1

Dictionary was reworked to mark up every pesky citation. If you find incorrect one, please, inform us. By the way, few sub-definitions were fixed.

Links to the 'Lateinische Synonyme und Etymologieen' (only in the "GoldenDict" variant) were changed from the beautiful scans made by Bayerische Staatsbibliothek ([example][2]) to the versions on Google Books ([example][3]) which are more convenient for reading. If you often use this German dictionary and prefer old-style links, please, contact us.

Footnotes (three pieces over the entire book) are added to the corresponding articles. So, whole content of the book now is correctly represented in our dictionary.

Many additional headwords were added, but this work is not finished yet.
