title:  "GoldenDict Mobile"

Users requested several times to make dictionaries compatible with [GoldenDict Mobile][2]. Among supported formats, _StarDict_ is one of the most advanced, but this application has very limited support of it, particulary it does not understand "Stardict resource database file" (".rifo").

Finally, we came to the solution to embed styles and images inside of every article, even if it makes resulting files 5 times bigger.

New files in StarDict format are added to the release of dictionary [Ramshorn1860][1]. Hope you find it convenient.
